# wordcut
It's a way to get images from a folder, compact, format and send directly to a word (.doc) file.

I stucked when i tried to use pyinstaller for change to a .exe file... works well but don't bring the imagens and icons. :(

MainDIsplay.py is the Pyqt5 display file
Modulo_de_funcoes.py is the logic
test.py is for tests without using GUI
